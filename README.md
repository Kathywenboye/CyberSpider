# CyberSpider
Create a software program to discover latent cyberattacks based on open hash table.

Mainly contribute to DiskMultiMap.h, DiskMultiMap.cpp, IntelWeb.h, IntelWeb.cpp. 

Build a multimap class called DiskMultiMap that implements a disk-based, open hash table-based multimap; build a class called IntelWeb to to digest the entire contents of one or more log data files and organize this information into an efficient disk-based data structure that can be "crawled" to discover malicious entities and also "purge" them.
